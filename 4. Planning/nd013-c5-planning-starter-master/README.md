# Project: Motion Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles

In this project, you will implement two of the main components of a traditional hierarchical planner: The Behavior Planner and the Motion Planner. Both will work in unison to be able to:

1. Avoid static objects (cars, bicycles and trucks) parked on the side of the road (but still invading the lane). The vehicle must avoid crashing with these vehicles by executing either a “nudge” or a “lane change” maneuver.

2. Handle any type of intersection (3-way, 4-way intersections and roundabouts) by STOPPING in all of them (by default)

3. Track the centerline on the traveling lane.

To accomplish this, you will implement:

* Behavioral planning logic using Finite State Machines - FSM
* Static objects collision checking.
* Path and trajectory generation using cubic spirals
* Best trajectory selection though a cost function evaluation. This cost function will mainly perform a collision check and a proximity check to bring cost higher as we get closer or collide with objects but maintaining a bias to stay closer to the lane center line.

## Dependency - Udacity VM Workspace
The state code in this repository is aligned to run on the Udacity VM workspace. Refer to the classroom page **Ubuntu VM Workspace - Overview** to learn how to access the VM workspace and its restrictions and best practices. 

However, to set up your local machine with the necessary tools, you must have either *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (WSL) or *Ubuntu 20.04* or *18.04 LTS*. Below is the list of tools installed in the Udacity VM workspace that you should install on your local machine.

- [CARLA simulator 0.9.9.4](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.9). <br/>
    You can find more details at [CARLA Quick Start Installation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/). The deb installation is the easiest way to get the latest release in Linux.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 1AF1527DE64CB8D9
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] http://dist.carla.org/carla $(lsb_release -sc) main"
    sudo apt-get update # Update the Debian package index
    sudo apt-get install carla-simulator=0.9.10-2 
    ```

    The installation directory must be **/opt/carla-simulator/** on your Linux machine. To verify, open a terminal an launch CARLA as:
    ```bash
    cd /opt/carla-simulator
    ./CarlaUE4.sh
    ```
    The Carla Simulator should launch in a few seconds. You can close it after verification.

    # Install python requirements

    ```


# Instructions
The sections ahead will guide you through the steps to build and run the project. 


## Step 1. Log into VM Workspace

Open the VM workspace and log into the VM to practice the current project. 
Once you log into the VM, open a Terminal window. 

<br/><br/>

## Step 2. Clone the Repository

Fork the repository to your Github account and clone the repository to the workspace using the commands below. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd013-c5-planning-starter.git
```

Change to the project directory.
```bash
cd nd013-c5-planning-starter/project
```

<br/><br/>

## Step 3. Review the starter files
You will find the following files in the project directory.

```bash
.
├── cserver_dir
├── install-ubuntu.sh
├── manual_control.py
├── run_carla.sh
├── run_main.sh
├── simulatorAPI.py
└── starter_files
```

<br/><br/>

## Step 4. Start the Carla Server
Start the Carla server by executing the following shell script. 
```bash
./run_carla.sh
```
This file will, in turn, execute the **/opt/carla-simulator/CarlaUE4.sh** script. 


<br/><br/>

## Step 5. Install Dependencies
Open another Terminal tab, and change to the **nd013-c5-planning-starter/project**  directory. Execute the following shell script to install the project-specific dependencies. 
```bash
./install-ubuntu.sh
```
This file will install utilities such as, `libuv1-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `libz-dev`, `uWebSockets`. 

<br/><br/>

## Step 6. Update the Project Code

Change to the **starter_files/** directory 
```bash
cd starter_files/
```

Before you start coding, we strongly recommend you look at the rubric in your classroom, against which the human Mentor will review your submission. Your submission must satisfy all rubric criteria to pass the project; otherwise, the Mentor may ask you to re-submit. 


Update the following files as per the classroom instructions. 
- **behavior_planner_FSM.cpp**
- **cost_functions.cpp**
- **motion_planner.cpp**
- **velocity_profile_generator.cpp**
- **planning_params.h**

<br/>

> **Important**: At this moment, it is important to save your work and push it back to the remote Github repository. 

<br/><br/>

### Update Notes
In the previous version of the project starter code, we had **libcarla-install/** and **rpclib/** directories inside the starter files. But, those directories are no longer needed in the current version of the starter code because the current **CMakeLists.txt** file has corresponding `includes` and `libs` added at `/opt/carla-source`.

To give some old context, when we had **rpclib/** directory inside the starter files, we used to compile the **rpclib** library using the following commands. 
```bash
cd starter_files
rm -rf rpclib
git clone https://github.com/rpclib/rpclib.git
```
This library is a **msgpack-rpc** library written using modern C++. The goal of building this library was to provide a simple RPC solution. However, all of the above-mentioned steps are **no longer needed** in the current version of the project strarter code. 

<br/><br/>

## Step 7. Build and Execute the Project

When you finish updating the project files, you can execute the project using the commands below. 

```bash
# Build the project
# Run the following commands from the starter_files/ directory
cmake .
# The command below compiles your c++ code. Run it after each time you edit the CPP or Header files
make
```

```bash
# Run the project
cd ..
# Run the following commands from the nd013-c5-planning-starter/project directory
./run_main.sh
```
If the execution fails silently, you can use **ctrl + C** to stop, and try again. 

Another possible error you may get is `bind failed. Error: Address already in use`. In such a case, you can kill the process occupying the required port using the commands below.

```bash
ps -aux | grep carla
# Use the IDs displayed in the output of the last command. 
kill id     
```

<br/><br/>

## Step 8. Check the Rubric and Submit

Re-check the rubric in the classroom and ensure that your submission satisfies all rubric criteria to pass the project. Once you are confident, submit the project.
