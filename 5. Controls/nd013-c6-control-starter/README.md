# Control and Trajectory Tracking for Autonomous Vehicle

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to design a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to perform vehicle trajectory tracking. Given a trajectory as an array of locations, and a simulation environment, you will design and code a PID controller and test its efficiency on the CARLA simulator used in the industry.

## Dependency - Udacity VM Workspace
The state code in this repository is aligned to run on the Udacity VM workspace. Refer to the classroom page **Ubuntu VM Workspace - Overview** to learn how to access the VM workspace and its restrictions and best practices. 

However, to set up your local machine with the necessary tools, you must have either *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (WSL) or *Ubuntu 20.04* or *18.04 LTS*. Below is the list of tools installed in the Udacity VM workspace that you should install on your local machine.

- [CARLA simulator 0.9.9.4](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.9). <br/>
    You can find more details at [CARLA Quick Start Installation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/). The deb installation is the easiest way to get the latest release in Linux.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 1AF1527DE64CB8D9
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] http://dist.carla.org/carla $(lsb_release -sc) main"
    sudo apt-get update # Update the Debian package index
    sudo apt-get install carla-simulator=0.9.10-2 
    ```

    The installation directory must be **/opt/carla-simulator/** on your Linux machine. To verify, open a terminal an launch CARLA as:
    ```bash
    cd /opt/carla-simulator
    ./CarlaUE4.sh
    ```
    The Carla Simulator should launch in a few seconds. You can close it after verification.

    # Install python requirements

    ```

# Instructions
The sections ahead will guide you through the steps to build and run the project. 

## Step 1. Log into VM Workspace

Open the VM workspace and log into the VM to practice the current project. 
Once you log into the VM, open a Terminal window. 

<br/><br/>

## Step 2. Clone the Repository

Fork the repository to your Github account and clone the repository to the workspace using the commands below. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd013-c6-control-starter.git
```

Change to the project directory.
```bash
cd nd013-c6-control-starter/project
```

<br/><br/>

## Step 3. Review the starter files
You will find the following files in the project directory.

```bash
.
├── cserver_dir
├── install-ubuntu.sh
├── manual_control.py
├── pid_controller/     # TODO Files
├── plot_pid.py
├── run_main_pid.sh
├── simulatorAPI.py
├── steer_pid_data.txt
└── throttle_pid_data.txt
```

<br/><br/>

## Step 4. Start the Carla Server
Start the Carla server by executing the following shell script. 
```bash
/opt/carla-simulator/CarlaUE4.sh
```


<br/><br/>

## Step 5. Install Dependencies
Open another Terminal tab, and change to the **nd013-c6-control-starter/project**  directory. Execute the following shell script to install the project-specific dependencies. 
```bash
./install-ubuntu.sh
```
This file will install utilities such as, `libuv1-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `libz-dev`, `uWebSockets`. 

<br/><br/>

## Step 6. Update the Project Code

Change to the **pid_controller/** directory.
```bash
cd pid_controller/
```
Before you start coding, we strongly recommend you look at the rubric in your classroom, against which the human Mentor will review your submission. Your submission must satisfy all rubric criteria to pass the project; otherwise, the Mentor may ask you to re-submit. 


Update the following files as per the classroom instructions. You will TODO markers as well in these files. 

- **pid_controller.h**
- **pid_controller.cpp**
- **main.cpp**


<br/>

> **Important**: At this moment, it is important to save your work and push it back to the remote Github repository. 

<br/><br/>

### Update Notes
In the previous version of the project starter code, we had **libcarla-install/** and **rpclib/** directories inside the **pid_controller/** directory. But, those directories are no longer needed in the current version of the starter code because the current **CMakeLists.txt** file has corresponding `includes` and `libs` added at `/opt/carla-source`.

To give some old context, when we had **rpclib/** directory inside the starter files, we used to compile the **rpclib** library using the following commands. 
```bash
cd pid_controller/
rm -rf rpclib
git clone https://github.com/rpclib/rpclib.git
```
This library is a **msgpack-rpc** library written using modern C++. The goal of building this library was to provide a simple RPC solution. However, all of the above-mentioned steps are **no longer needed** in the current version of the project strarter code. 

<br/><br/>

## Step 7. Build and Execute the Project

When you finish updating the project files, you can execute the project using the commands below. 

```bash
# Build the project
# Run the following commands from the pid_controller/ directory
cmake .
# The command below compiles your c++ code. Run it after each time you edit the CPP or Header files
make
```

```bash
# Run the project
cd ..
# Run the following commands from the nd013-c6-control-starter/project directory
./run_main_pid.sh
```
If the execution fails silently, you can use **ctrl + C** to stop, and try again. 

Another possible error you may get is `bind failed. Error: Address already in use`. In such a case, you can kill the process occupying the required port using the commands below.

```bash
ps -aux | grep carla
# Use the IDs displayed in the output of the last command. 
kill id     
```

<br/><br/>

## Step 8. Check the Rubric and Submit

Re-check the rubric in the classroom and ensure that your submission satisfies all rubric criteria to pass the project. Once you are confident, submit the project.
